# Calendar

## Introduction

This project is a simple calendar app developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can view and navigate through the calendar, select specific dates, and add holidays.

## Usage

To run the calendar application, open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Holiday Dates Format

In the text file containing holiday dates, each line should follow the structure:

YYYY/MM/DD-r
where:
- `YYYY` is the year,
- `MM` is the month,
- `DD` is the day,
- `r` is either "repeat" or "norepeat", indicating whether the holiday repeats annually or not.

Example:  
2024/02/08-repeat  
2024/04/27-repeat  
2024/05/01-norepeat
